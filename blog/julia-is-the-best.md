With many portfolio sites on the internet, sometimes it is great to add something that helps drive people to your content, specifically your projects.

Today I'm going to show you how to apply subtle gradient styles to text to create an outstanding effect that is under-utilized.

**Step 1**

```
<div class="CTA">
```

```
            <div class="CTA-letter-container">
```

```
              <p class="CTA-letter">J</p>
```

```
              <p class="CTA-letter-shadow">J</p>
```

```
            </div>
```

```
            <p class="CTA-text">
```

```
              <span class="CTA-title">JavaScript</span>
```

```
              <span class="CTA-title-sub">My favourite programming language.</span>
```

```
            </p>
```

```
            <a class="CTA-link">My Work</a
```

```
</div>
```
